			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_1_3_01">I chose this generative art</a> to work off of because it was under the generative art section.</li>
					<li>I chose a random one since the previews were not done loading, but I like the one I chose.</li>
					<li>I copied my previous experiment by making the mouse position change the color of the line. I also made the dots the same color as the line so that they looked better.</li>
					<li>I also increased the height of the canvas to 500 because 256 looked too small. I then changed it to 400 because 500 was too big and affected the placement of the dots.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I wanted to work with "noise" more so I tried to make the dots' positions dependent on more noise, but it seemed to mess up. (the dots did not match the lines)</li>
					<li>I then realized it was because the vertices' y position did not use the same "noiseY". This fixed it, but it did not look significantly different.</li>
					<li>I also removed the dots so that you can only see the lines</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I wanted to make the lines "smoother" to look more like a wave. I also wanted to make it animated and not dependent on the mouse position, so I made it dependent on the frameCount. This made it look animated, but it still wasn't smooth/wavy unless the mouse position was very low. I still had to use the mouse position because I was not sure what variable to make it dependent on that would not be increasing or decreasing significantly.</li>
					<li>I realized that I could make the lines begin very jagged, even out, then back to jagged when the mouse position increased if I change mapping.</li>
					<li>I then tried to make the color of the lines more dependent on the mouse position because the previous possible colors were only black and blue. I used the mouseX, mouseY, and the hypotenuse so that all possible colors (0, 0, 0) to (255, 255, 255) could show up.</li>
					<li>I realized that noiseY did not do anything so I removed it. I also increased the stroke weight so that the lines looked bigger and "wavy-er"</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I did everything on my own again.</li>
					<li>I did not manage to get the lines to look like waves, but I think it was because I used the mouse position. I did get it to be animated though, which makes it look a lot better.</li>
					<li>I also liked that I found a formula to make the mouse position create almost all possible colors.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
