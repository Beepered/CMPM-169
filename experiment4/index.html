			<h1>Experiment 4 - Sound and Images</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I took <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/sound-mic-input.html">this example</a> because I wanted to work on something with the microphone. It is a ball that bounces based on the microphone sound input.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>First I tried to get the microphone to change the color of the ball, because I always start with color. This did not work, but I immediately got interested in making the ball jump higher</li>
					<li>did not understand what was done before, so I mapped the input * 150 (input is 0 - 1) to the height, which made the ball start at the top and go downwards with sound.</li>
					<li>I did not know why, but I thought that I saw the input change the size of the ball so I changed my attention to making sound change the height AND size of the ball (I read the code wrong, it only changed the height).</li>
					<li>As I got more used to the sound only being from 0 to 1, I got the ball to start at the bottom (I was confused about the y position) and made it so that the size and height change more dramatically with sound. The color also can change from white to black.</li>
					<li>I did not know how to make the colors change into more than white or black so I looked into images. I saw <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/image-load-and-display-image.html">this example</a> and wondered if I could make the ball an image that grew and shrank.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I put an image in where the ball was and made it grow based on microphone input. I got the image to be in the middle of the screen even when the width was changing which was difficult because I could not find the origin point.</li>
					<li>I felt like the code was finished because it was funny watching the image grow like it was talking and bouncing.</li>
					<li>But then I wanted more bouncing images to follow the main image, so I looked at <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/image-transparency.html">another example</a> to create more images at lower opacities.</li>
					<li>I wanted there to be a trail of the same image that lags behind the main one, but then ended up making a flappy bird clone</li>
					<li>I put a new image that moves up if the sound is high and down if the sound is too low. It does not flow well since it does not have any velocity.</li>
					<li>I wanted there to be more movement so I tried to get the image to bounce around the screen. Louder = faster, quiet = slower</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I did all the work on my own again. I don't feel like I "innovated" a lot, but it is very funny looking at my work.</li>
					<li>I did not get the trail of images that lag behind, but I still like how funny it is</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				Please allow microphone use. The whole thing relies on the microphone sound.
				If nothing shows up, then just use this link (<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/btrieu2/sketches/eC1CJ1x90">https://editor.p5js.org/btrieu2/sketches/eC1CJ1x90</a>), allow the microphone use, and click "Run".
