			<h1>Experiment 2 - Generative Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_2_3_01">The art that inspired me</a> 
					is of some wobbly lines that follow the mouse cursor and the lines are always moving around in unpredictable ways.
					I thought that the art was very interesting and would be my fit to replicate.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I had already played around in p5.js before with a project about <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/btrieu2/sketches/JX2vwb0qI">a circle that changed size and moved around erratically</a>, but could be influenced by the mouse cursor. The circle would also change color based on the opposite of the background color (ex: background is black, circle is white).</p>
				<p>I did not like that the only colors were black and white so I used the mouse position to give the lines color. I thought that having a rainbow across the screen would look pretty, but I did not know how to do the math to get mouseX and mouseY to be all colors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Other than having the colors change, which is the best change that I made (in my opinion), I could not think of many other ways to improve on it. I shrank the shape size and removed or changed parts that I did not like. Instead of using the mouse click to make a new circle, I made it clear the screen.
					I also wanted to be able to change the shape of the lines during run-time, so I made the down and up arrow keys change how many angles/edges there were and the left and right arrow keys change how frequently the shape changes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section"> 
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on every part, but I did borrow the code from <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_2_3_01">http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/</a>.
					At first I wanted to submit the project on the wobbly circle, but then I figured it was not enough imitation because it was just my own code.
					It also did not interest me much, because it was just a wobbly circle.</p>
