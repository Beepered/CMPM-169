			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I didn't really understand how to do the assignment so I took an example from section. I also did not want to create a CSV file on my own and do not understand how to use an API.</li>
					<li>The <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/tttPKxZi">example I took from</a> is a rotating map of the earth with where earthquakes took place.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>First I made the earth rotatable using the mouse position</li>
					<li>I wanted to add another picture on top of the earth, but then I felt like it detracted from the idea of seeing earthquakes on the earth.</li>
					<li>I wanted to try to take a <a href="https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api">dad joke API</a> and take the letters from the joke it returned but I could not do it. I only found code to print it out but not to take the result and use it</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I figured that instead of rotating the earth, you could just see the earthquakes on a flat image. My goal was to show the earthquakes using colors to show the intensity.</li>
					<li>I managed to get the image of the earth after a lot of attempts at changing the images position</li>
					<li>Then I realized I did not know how to scale the longitude and latitude with the image size, so I had to go back on my decision and use the 3D sphere.</li>
					<li>I changed the search from just 4.5 magnitude to all earthquakes from 30 days, but when it didn't load, I switched to 7 days.</li>
					<li>I got the boxes to change colors based on how high the magnitude was</li>
					<li>I added 1 to the magnitude so that the boxes were not too small, but it created this one REALLY large box, but it was already larger before the change. Later, I changed it to 0.5</li>
					<li>I made each click change which table to draw from. It goes all hour, all day, then all week. So now when you click you can see how much it changed in a week.</li>
					<li>I also made each click change the background color to go darker and show text to display how far it is showing. I also made it so that any key pressed would zoom in until the zoom was too much then it would reset.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I did everything on my own again. This assignment was the hardest because I did not know what to do. I had never worked with APIs or CSV files and thought that we had to make our own. My only idea before using the earth was to take every letter from something and put it on a graph. The final result is pretty cool and looks official.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				Mouse the mouse to move the Earth. Left click to see earthquakes from the past hour, day, or week. Press any button on the keyboard to zoom in.
